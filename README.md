# Graph-project-Dijsktras-algorithm
This is an an implementation of a directed weighted graph. The graph is used to give us a minimum cost to a single end point using an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

The algorithm can find the cheapest or lightest path form any source to any destination with 'n' of nodes with 'k' connections in the graph at O(n)^3 time.
